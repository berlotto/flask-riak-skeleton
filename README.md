# flask-riak-skeleton
===================

Skeleton of a Python Flask project, combining flask, riak, and html5boilerplate/twitter bootstrap.

The intention is to create a skeleton for my own projects where I will be using riak, flask, and possibly various flask related modules.

## Components (so far)
* flask
* initializr - html5boilerplate + twitter bootstrap.  See [initializr](http://www.initializr.com/)

> The source is rather rough and with very little comments.  However it should be self explanatory enough to get started.
